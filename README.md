# Azoth 🧪✨

**Computational distillation of the universal sensory optima** — the invariant essence (λ⋆) extracted from source flux, medium transmission, and irreducible noise.  
**Physics defines the ridge. Azoth reveals its peak.**

Version: v2.7.1 (shadow-locked)

## Overview

AZOTH is a **deterministic observatory** that evaluates universal sensory optima and stability geometry under physical constraint. It measures, but does not learn, optimize, or act.

No agents. No autonomy. No feedback loops beyond explicit observation.

## Governing Law

\[
\lambda^\ast = \arg\max_{\lambda} \left[ \frac{F(\lambda) \cdot T(\lambda)}{N_r(\lambda) + N_e(\lambda)} \right]
\]

Coherence horizon H₇ ≈ 0.7 emerges as scale-invariant attractor under perturbation.

## What's New in v2.7.1 / v1.7

- Root Reflection: Artifact integrity via sha256 + bytes
- Dashboard State: `dashboard_state.json` (authoritative) + `dashboard_feedback.json` (structured)
- Public Build: Static artifacts under `/public`
- Ω-basin Gate (H20): Stability → PASS/FAIL classification
- Run-scoped Artifacts: `/runs/run_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/`

## Codex Horizons

- H7: Coherence Horizon
- H16: Multi-scale Geometry
- H19: Drift Observability
- H20: Ω-basin Stability Gate
