# ⧉ AZOTH — Universal Sensory Optima Observatory (v1.6)

AZOTH is a deterministic observatory for identifying universal sensory optima
under physical constraint.

It measures—not learns, optimizes, or adapts.

## Governing Law
λ* = argmax_λ [ F(λ)·T(λ) / (N_r(λ)+N_e(λ)) ]

## Capabilities
• Multi-channel sensory evaluation  
• Triadic coherence folding  
• Temporal drift detection  
• Ω-basin stability testing (H20)  
• Immutable historical snapshots  
• Cryptographically sealed state identity  

## Constraints
AZOTH contains no agents, no feedback loops, and no autonomy.
All glyphs are descriptive only.

## Codex Alignment
H7 — Coherence Horizon  
H16 — Multi-scale geometry  
H19 — Drift observability  
H20 — Ω-basin stability  

AZOTH feeds Codex measurements.
It does not evolve Codex.
