# ⧉ AZOTH — Universal Sensory Optima Observatory (v1.7)

AZOTH is a deterministic observatory that evaluates *universal sensory optima*
under physical constraint.

It **measures** stability geometry.
It does not learn, optimize itself, or act autonomously.

## Governing Law
λ* = argmax_λ [ F(λ)·T(λ) / (N_r(λ)+N_e(λ)) ]

## What v1.7 Adds
- **Root Reflection**: artifact integrity (sha256 + bytes) for reproducibility
- **Dashboard State Objects**:
  - dashboard_state.json (authoritative snapshot)
  - dashboard_feedback.json (GPT-consumable safe summary)
- **Public Build**: self-contained export under /public
- **Ω-basin gate (H20)**: converts stability into PASS/FAIL classification
- **Run-scoped artifacts**: /runs/run_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/

## Codex Alignment
- **H7** — Coherence Horizon (target ridge)
- **H19** — Drift observability (ΔΦ proxy via temporal change)
- **H20** — Ω-basin stability (robustness under bounded perturbation)
- **H16 (context)** — multi-scale geometry (future: cross-environment stacking)

## Non-Claims / Safety
AZOTH contains no agents, no feedback loops, no autonomy.
Glyphs are descriptive compression only.
